  <h1>Unsupervised Learning</h1>
  <p>Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no output labels provided; instead, the algorithm tries to identify patterns and relationships within the data.</p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unlabeled Data:</strong> The training dataset does not include output labels, only input features.</li>
    <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> The process of grouping similar data points together.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Techniques to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Unsupervised Learning</h2>
  <p>Unsupervised learning is used in various fields for tasks such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer segmentation in marketing.</li>
    <li>Anomaly detection in fraud detection systems.</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems to suggest products or content.</li>
    <li>Genetic clustering in bioinformatics.</li>
    <li>Data compression and feature extraction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Popular Models in Unsupervised Learning</h2>
  <p>Several models are commonly used in unsupervised learning, including:</p>

  <h3>1. K-Means Clustering</h3>
  <p>K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster center and updates the centers based on the mean of assigned points.</p>

  <h3>2. Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
  <p>This method builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram) by either merging or splitting existing clusters based on their distance from one another.</p>

  <h3>3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
  <p>PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a new set of variables (principal components) that retain most of the variance in the data while reducing its dimensionality.</p>

  <h3>4. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</h3>
  <p>t-SNE is a powerful technique for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions, while preserving the structure of the data in a way that makes it easier to interpret.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Unsupervised learning is a critical approach in machine learning that allows computers to find hidden patterns and relationships in data without needing labeled examples. It plays a significant role in exploratory data analysis and feature learning.</p>
