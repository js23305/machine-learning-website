    <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
    <p>Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. In this method, each training example is paired with an output label, and the algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct output based on this data.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Labeled Data:</strong> The training dataset includes both input features and the corresponding output labels.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The algorithm learns by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Once trained, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Supervised learning is used in various fields for tasks such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spam detection in emails.</li>
        <li>Credit scoring in finance.</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis based on patient data.</li>
        <li>Image recognition and classification.</li>
        <li>Customer churn prediction in business.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Models in Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Several models are commonly used in supervised learning, including:</p>

    <h3>1. Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The model assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output.</p>

    <h3>2. Logistic Regression</h3>
    <p>Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability of a certain class or event existing, such as determining whether an email is spam or not.</p>

    <h3>3. Decision Trees</h3>
    <p>Decision trees use a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. They are easy to interpret and can be used for both classification and regression tasks.</p>

    <h3>4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h3>
    <p>SVMs are powerful classification algorithms that find the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the data. They can handle high-dimensional spaces and are effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.</p>

    <h3>5. Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). They are particularly effective for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Supervised learning is a fundamental approach in machine learning that enables computers to make predictions based on historical data. By using labeled datasets, various algorithms can learn to generalize from the training data and perform well on unseen data.</p>
